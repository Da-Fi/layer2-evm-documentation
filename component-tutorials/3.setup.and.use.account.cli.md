# Setup and Use the `account-cli` Tool

When working with Nervos' Layer 2 Testnet, there are some tools available that can greatly speed up the development process, and make life easier. One such tool is `account-cli`. This tool can be used to perform many common Layer 2 actions, such as depositing assets from Layer 1 to Layer 2.

## Setup the Godwoken Examples Tool Package

The `account-cli` tool is part of the Godwoken Examples tool package that is available on GitHub. The first step is to clone the `testnet-script` branch of this repo, which has been specifically tailored for use with these tasks.

Create `~/projects` directory if it doesn't exist.

Linux/MacOS:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/projects
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```ps
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ~/projects
```

Enter the `~/projects` directory and clone the repository.

```sh
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples -b testnet-script
```

The command above clones the repository and checks out the `testnet-script` branch which you will be using.

The next step is to configure the tool so it can properly interact with the Testnet. These commands will initialize the tool, then locate the addresses of the Layer 2 resources that are required by the tool and save them to a configuration file.

```sh
cd ~/projects/godwoken-examples
yarn
yarn build-all
yarn generate-testnet-configs
```

Your tools should now be ready to start interacting with Nervos Layer 2!

> Note: The 'account-cli' tool is using [CKB Node](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) and [ckb-indexer](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer). Make sure both tools are synced with Testnet on the first usage.
