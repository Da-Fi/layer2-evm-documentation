# 2. Deploy a Simple Ethereum Smart Contract on Polyjuice

Compiling and deploying a smart contract on Nervos' EVM compatible [Layer 2](../concept-explainers/structure.md#layer-1-layer-2) is a process that has a lot of similarity to the process on Ethereum. There are only a few small changes that need to be made.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will take a very basic smart contract written in Ethereum's Solidity, compile it to EVM bytecode, and deploy it to Godwoken on Layer 2.

The code we will be working with in this step will compile your smart contract and deploy it. This uses the original versions of Web3.js and Hardhat for Ethereum.

The instructions will provide a basic smart contract you can work with, but you should feel free to use any smart contract of your choosing. However, we recommend only using basic smart contracts that have a functions to read and write basic values to ensure you can complete this task and future tasks.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [previous task](1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. You will also need the private key and Testnet address from the previous task in order to proceed. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

### 1. Prepare Your Ethereum Private Key

You need to extract private key for your **Ethereum** account. This private key will be used by the tooling to deploy your smart contract on Layer 2.

> Note: Never use a private key that is associated with a real account for any of these tasks. The following steps will show you how to extract your private key from MetaMask, but you should never do this using a MetaMask installation that you use for real funds since this could potentially leak infomation that could compromise your account.

If you need instructions on how to extract your private key from MetaMask, follow the steps in [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/5.extract.ethereum.private.key.md).

### 2. Clone and Setup the Code Examples Repository

In this step you will clone the code examples repository. It contains material required by this task, and future tasks.

Create `~/projects` directory if it doesn't exist.

Linux/MacOS:

```
mkdir -p ~/projects
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ~/projects
```

Enter the `~/projects` directory and clone the repository.

```
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/layer2-evm-documentation.git
cd layer2-evm-documentation
```

Then we install all dependencies:

```
yarn install-all
```

### 3. Compile the Smart Contract and Copy the Artifact

Before you deploy a smart contract you need to compile it. This can be done in several ways, but our instructions will compile it using the Hardhat compiler. If you have an alternate method you prefer, feel free to use it.

#### Using the Hardhat Compiler

Provided below is a simple smart contract example that you can use, however you can use any smart contract you wish for this task.

The example Solidity smart contract below is `SimpleStorage.sol`, and it is located in the `code-examples/2-deploy-contract/contracts` directory.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
  uint storedData;

  constructor() payable {
    storedData = 123;
  }

  function set(uint x) public payable {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() public view returns (uint) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
```

The command below can be used to compile the Solidity into EVM bytecode using the Hardhat compiler.

```
cd ~/projects/layer2-evm-documentation/code-examples/2-deploy-contract/
yarn compile
```

After the command is complete you will find the compiled file in the `build/contracts` directory. ie: `code-examples/2-deploy-contract/artifacts/contracts/SimpleStorage.sol/SimpleStorage.json`.

#### Alternative: Using the Remix Compiler

If for some reason the Hardhat compiler isn't working, you can use the [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org) web-based compiler as an alternative, but we will not be providing detailed instructions on using Remix. This is only recommended if you are already familiar with this tool, or you are having trouble with the Hardhat compiler.

After uploading and compiling your Solidity code, you will receive a JSON file that can be found in Remix's "artifacts" directory. Place the contents of this file in `code-examples/2-deploy-contract/artifacts/contracts/<YOUR_CONTRACT_NAME>.sol/<YOUR_CONTRACT_NAME>.json` directory.

### 4. Deploy a Smart Contract Using Web3.js

In the [code-examples/2-deploy-contract/](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/layer2-evm-documentation/tree/master/code-examples/2-deploy-contract) directory you will find the script needed to deploy a smart contract to Nervos Layer 2.

First, update the Ethereum private key in the file [code-examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js](../code-examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js). Replace `<YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your Ethereum private key. This should be the private key that corresponds with the Ethereum account that was funded previously. This will be used to deploy the smart contract on Layer 2.

Run the `code-examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js` script via console using the following commands:

```
cd ~/projects/layer2-evm-documentation/code-examples/2-deploy-contract/
node index.js SimpleStorage
```

After running the command, the contract should deploy without any errors. You will be presented with a transaction hash, and an Ethereum contract address.

Example Output:

```
âžœ node index.js SimpleStorage

Found file: ./artifacts/contracts/SimpleStorage.sol/SimpleStorage.json
Deploying contract...
Transaction hash: 0x285f0555dbf024fbcaa54220a02830a365e084a77d2c9f3b818e77e1622a24a4
Deployed contract address: 0xE12E1488A9F2b1063534941D2E72e051C7989612
```
