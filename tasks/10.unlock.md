# 10. Complete Withdrawal Process by Unlocking the Funds

**Caution: This tutorial hasn't been updated for new version of Godwoken network (v1). The information in this guide might be out of date.**

A withdrawal in Godwoken is a two step process. The first part is initializing the withdraw, and second is unlocking the funds. After the withdrawal is initiated, a five day challenge period begins. This is a period where Layer 2 network operators have time to check and raise issues with any potentially malicious transactions and rollback if necessary.

In the [previous task](9.withdraw.md), you initiated the withdrawal. In this task you will complete the process by issuing the `unlock` command.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will "unlock" the funds after withdrawal waiting period. This will complete withdrawal process from Nervos' Layer 2. Remember, you can only unlock funds that you've initiated withdrawal of previously.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [withdrawal task](9.withdraw.md) and wait five days.

### 1. Go to "Create Layer 2 Account" tab on CKB Tools website <a href="#1.-go-to-create-layer-2-account-tab-on-ckb-tools-website" id="1.-go-to-create-layer-2-account-tab-on-ckb-tools-website"></a>

Start by visiting [dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account](https://dev.ckb.tools/create-layer2-account). Make sure MetaMask wallet is installed in your browser and one of the accounts is connected to the page.

If you see pending withdrawal request that you've already created but you don't see "Unlock" button it means you need to wait longer.

### 3. Unlock funds <a href="#2.-submit-withdrawal-request" id="2.-submit-withdrawal-request"></a>

If you see a request with "Unlock" button available then go ahead and click it. You will see a MetaMask popup.

Press "Sign" to complete the withdrawal process. You should receive success message:

If you see message about transaction being submitted, then congratulations! You've successfully withdrawn funds from Nervos' Layer 2. üëè They exist now on Nervos' Layer 1 where they be used with layer 1 dApps, or be moved to another blockchain using [Force Bridge](../concept-explainers/infrastructure.md#force-bridge).

### Potential Errors

If you see error: "Unlock failed. Please try again." - you have to try few more times. Unlock process is dependent on the last submitted Layer 2 block to Layer 1, which changes once per minute. If you submit your transaction with old Layer 2 block (which can happen) it will fail, but don't worry - your funds will be safe and next try should be successful.
